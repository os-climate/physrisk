## The following checklist items have been completed for each notebook in this PR:

- [ ] Proofread by other team member for grammar and spelling
- [ ] Proofread by other team member for coherence and reproducibility (does the analysis make sense as you read through the code and markdown from top to bottom?)
- [ ] Links checked and redirect correctly
- [ ] There is a top markdown cell describing what the notebook does
- [ ] There is a concluding markdown cell that summarizes the findings and outlines any next steps
- [ ] All plots are the same size
- [ ] All plots use seaborn (unless a specific functionality requires a different package)
- [ ] All plots have a title, labeled axis, and some written description of the insights uncovered in the graph
- [ ] Assuming correct environment, clicking "run all" works without error
- [ ] All cells have been run and their output is displayed
- [ ] Markdown headers are used to break up different sections
- [ ] No error or warning messages are present in the outputs
- [ ] All outputs are truncated to the minimum size required for explanation. No more than 20 rows.
- [ ] Cell execution counts are in order (a working "run all" was performed just before PR)
- [ ] All pre-commit checks pass
