# Physrisk

Physical climate risk calculation engine.

## About physrisk

An [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org) project, physrisk is a library for
assessing the physical effects of climate change and thereby the potential
benefit of measures to improve resilience.

An introduction and methodology is available in the
[Physical Risk Methodology document](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk/blob/main/methodology/PhysicalRiskMethodology.pdf).

Physrisk is primarily designed to run 'bottom-up' calculations that model
the impact of climate hazards on large numbers of individual assets
(including natural) and operations. These calculations can be used to assess
financial risks or socio-economic impacts. To do this physrisk collects:

- hazard indicators and
- models of vulnerability of assets/operations to hazards.

Hazard indicators are on-boarded from public resources or inferred from
climate projections, e.g. from CMIP or CORDEX data sets. Indicators are
created from code in the
[hazard repository](https://github.com/os-climate/hazard) to make
calculations as transparent as possible.

Physrisk is also designed to be a hosted, e.g. to provide on-demand
calculations.
[physrisk-api](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk-api) and
[physrisk-ui](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk-ui) provide an example
API and user interface. A
[development version of the UI](https://physrisk-ui-physrisk.apps.odh-cl2.apps.os-climate.org)
is hosted by OS-Climate.

## Using the library

The library can be run locally, although access to the hazard indicator data
is needed. The library is installed via:

```bash
pip install physrisk-lib
```

Hazard indicator data is freely available. Members of the project are able to
access OS-Climate S3 buckets. Credentials are available from the
[OS-Climate S3 keys](https://console-openshift-console.apps.odh-cl2.apps.os-climate.org/k8s/ns/physrisk/secrets/physrisk-s3-keys).
Information about the project is available via the
[community-hub](https://github.com/os-climate/OS-Climate-Community-Hub).
Non-members are able to download or copy hazard indicator data.

Hazard indicator data can be downloaded or copied from the
'os-climate-public-data' bucket. A list of the keys to copy is available from
<https://os-climate-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/hazard/keys.txt>

An inventory of the hazard data is maintained in the
[hazard inventory](https://github.com/os-climate/hazard/blob/main/src/inventories/hazard/inventory.json)
(this is used by the physrisk library itself). The
[UI hazard viewer](https://physrisk-ui-physrisk.apps.odh-cl2.apps.os-climate.org)
is a convenient way to browse data sets.

Access to hazard event data requires setting of environment variables
specifying the S3 Bucket, for example:

```bash
OSC_S3_BUCKET=physrisk-hazard-indicators
OSC_S3_ACCESS_KEY=**********
OSC_S3_SECRET_KEY=**********
```

For use in a Jupyter environment, it is recommended to put the environment
variables in a credentials.env file and do, for example:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(dotenv_path=dotenv_path, override=True)
```
