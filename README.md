# Physrisk

Physical climate risk calculation engine.

## About physrisk

An [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org) project, physrisk is a library for
assessing the physical effects of climate change and thereby the potential
benefit of measures to improve resilience.

An introduction and methodology can be found in the
[online documentation](https://physrisk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Physrisk is primarily designed to run 'bottom-up' calculations that model
the impact of climate hazards on large numbers of individual assets
(including natural) and operations. These calculations can be used to assess
financial risks or socio-economic impacts. To do this physrisk collects:

- hazard indicators and
- models of vulnerability of assets/operations to hazards.

Hazard indicators are on-boarded from public resources or inferred from
climate projections, e.g. from CMIP or CORDEX data sets. Indicators are
created from code in the
[hazard repository](https://github.com/os-climate/hazard) to make
calculations as transparent as possible.

Physrisk is also designed to be a hosted, e.g. to provide on-demand
calculations.
[physrisk-api](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk-api) and
[physrisk-ui](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk-ui) provide an example
API and user interface. A
[development version of the UI](https://physrisk-ui-physrisk.apps.osc-cl1.apps.os-climate.org)
is hosted by OS-Climate.

## Using the library

The library can be run locally. The library is installed via:

```bash
pip install physrisk-lib
```

Hazard indicator data is freely available via the [Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative, here](https://registry.opendata.aws/os-climate-physrisk/).
Information about the project is available via the
[community-hub](https://github.com/os-climate/OS-Climate-Community-Hub).

An inventory of the hazard data is maintained in the
[hazard inventory](https://github.com/os-climate/hazard/blob/main/src/inventories/hazard/inventory.json)
(this is used by the physrisk library itself). The
[UI hazard viewer](https://physrisk-ui-physrisk.apps.osc-cl1.apps.os-climate.org)
is a convenient way to browse data sets.

A good place to start is the Getting Started section in the documentation site which has a number of walk-throughs.
