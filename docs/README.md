Physrisk documentation
==============================

In order to develop locally, run the command:

``
make html
``

A Read the Docs process builds to: https://physrisk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.

Currently ``requirements-docs.txt`` is used by Read the Docs and requires all physrisk packages in order to generate API correctly.
