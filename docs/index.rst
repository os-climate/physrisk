Physical Risk and Resilience
=============================

Physrisk is a library for assessing the physical effects of climate change and thereby the potential benefit of measures to improve resilience.
Physrisk is primarily designed to run 'bottom-up' calculations that model the impact of climate hazards on large numbers of individual assets
(including natural) and operations. These calculations can be used to assess financial risks or socio-economic impacts. To do this physrisk collects:

- hazard indicators and
- models of vulnerability of assets/operations to hazards.

Hazard indicators are on-boarded from public resources or inferred from climate projections, e.g. from CMIP or CORDEX data sets. Indicators are created from code in the
[hazard repo](https://github.com/os-climate/hazard) to make calculations as transparent as possible.

Physrisk is also designed to be a hosted, e.g. to provide on-demand calculations. [physrisk-api](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk-api) and [physrisk-ui](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk-ui) provide an example API and user interface.
A [development version of the UI](https://physrisk-ui-sandbox.apps.odh-cl1.apps.os-climate.org) is hosted by OS-Climate.
