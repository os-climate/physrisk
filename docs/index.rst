Physical risk and resilience
=============================

Physrisk is a library for assessing the physical effects of climate change and thereby the potential benefit of measures to improve resilience.
Physrisk is primarily designed to run 'bottom-up' calculations that model the impact of climate hazards on large numbers of individual assets
(including natural). These calculations can be used to assess financial risks or socio-economic impacts. To do this physrisk collects:

- hazard indicators and
- models of the vulnerability of assets to hazards.

Hazard indicators, that is quantities that quantify a hazard, are on-boarded from public data sets or inferred from climate projections, e.g. from CMIP or CORDEX data sets. In both cases, indicator data is created from code in the
`hazard repo <https://github.com/os-climate/hazard>`_, open-source to make the data lineage as transparent as possible.

The `physrisk repo <https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk>`_ contains the main calculation engine.

Physrisk is also designed to be a hosted, e.g. to provide on-demand calculations; the project is a co-operative of members some of whom need to integrate physical risk calculation into other systems. `physrisk-api <https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk-api>`_ and `physrisk-ui <https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk-ui>`_ provide an example API and user interface.

A `development or 'sandbox' version of the UI <https://physrisk-ui-physrisk.apps.osc-cl1.apps.os-climate.org>`_ is hosted by OS-Climate. Although used for demonstration and test, this is a useful way to explore the available hazard data.

Also see the `OSC webpage <https://os-climate.org/physical-risk-resilience/>`_

The getting-started section contains a number of examples that provide a walk-through of physrisk's functionality, via API then running locally. The methodology document gives a more detailed introduction to the subject and describes the models in more formal detail. The user-guide describes the design and conventions of physrisk and implementation detail for sourcing hazard indicator and vulnerability data; it is there, and in the code, that the details of data sources can be found.
