==========

If you are looking for the methodology of Physrisk or information about the different hazard indicators and vulnerability models, please check the `methodology document <methodology.html>`_. If it is not library-related, it should be there. Please see also `GitHub Contributing <https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for how to get set up.

The following sections document the structures and conventions of Physrisk and assumes some familiarity with the calculation of Physical Climate Risk (see `methodology document <methodology.html>`_ introduction).
