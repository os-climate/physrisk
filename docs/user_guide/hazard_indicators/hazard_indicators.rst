Hazard indicators
=================

The following sections cover hazard indicators, starting with a description of the conventions for storing hazard indicator data sets. Subsequent sections provide documentation in addition to the hazards description in the hazard indicator inventory. Typically this is needed when non-trivial transformation is performed as part of an on-boarding task or if the hazard indicator is derived from an original model.
