Vulnerability
=============
The following sections provide an overview of how vulnerability models can be created in physrisk. For the most part, this is now done via *vulnerability configuration* that is described in the next section. It is possible to define custom vulnerability models in code but this is typically only needed for special cases.

Vulnerability configuration is generated programmatically from a number of different sources. Notebooks can be created for each family of vulnerability curves to document how this is done.
