Flood intensity is provided as a _return period_ map: each point comprises a curve of inundation depths for 9 different return periods (also known as reoccurrence periods). If a flood event has depth $d_i$ with return period of $r_i$ this implies that the probability of a flood event with depth greater than $d_i$ occurring in any one year is $1 / r_i$; this is the _exceedance probability_.

Flood intensity is provided as a _return period_ map: each point comprises a curve of inundation depths for 9 different return periods (also known as reoccurrence periods). If a flood event has depth $d_i$ with return period of $r_i$ this implies that the probability of a flood event with depth greater than $d_i$ occurring in any one year is $1 / r_i$; this is the _exceedance probability_. Aqueduct Floods is based on Global Flood Risk with IMAGE Scenarios (GLOFRIS); see [here](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/publications) for more details.\n\nFor more details and relevant citations see the\n[OS-Climate Physical Climate Risk Methodology document](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk/blob/main/methodology/PhysicalRiskMethodology.pdf).",
