Flood intensity is provided as a _return period_ map: each point comprises a curve of inundation depths for 9 different return periods (also known as reoccurrence periods). If a flood event has depth $d_i$ with return period of $r_i$ this implies that the probability of a flood event with depth greater than $d_i$ occurring in any one year is $1 / r_i$; this is the _exceedance probability_.

Flood intensity is provided as a _return period_ map: each point comprises a curve of inundation depths for 9 different return periods (also known as reoccurrence periods). If a flood event has depth $d_i$ with return period of $r_i$ this implies that the probability of a flood event with depth greater than $d_i$ occurring in any one year is $1 / r_i$; this is the _exceedance probability_. Aqueduct Floods is based on Global Flood Risk with IMAGE Scenarios (GLOFRIS); see [here](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/publications) for more details.\n\nFor more details and relevant citations see the\n[OS-Climate Physical Climate Risk Methodology document](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk/blob/main/methodology/PhysicalRiskMethodology.pdf).\n",

Synthetic tropical cyclone datasets can help overcome these problems. Here we present a new global dataset created by IRIS, the ImpeRIal college Storm Model. IRIS is novel because, unlike other synthetic TC models, it only simulates the decay from the point of lifetime maximum intensity. This minimises the bias in the dataset. It takes input from 42 years of observed tropical cyclones and creates a 10,000 year synthetic dataset which is then validated against the observations. IRIS captures important statistical characteristics of the observed data. The return periods of the landfall maximum wind speed (1 minute sustained in m/s) are realistic globally. Climate model projections are used to adjust the life-time maximum intensity.\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/research/climate-science/modelling-tropical-cyclones/\n",

Sectoral water demand includes: domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock. Demand is displayed as a flux (centimeters/year).\n\n* **Water supply**: available blue water, the total amount of renewable freshwater available to a sub-basin with upstream consumption removed, includes surface flow, interflow, and groundwater recharge. Available blue water is displayed as a flux (centimeters/year).\n\n* **Water stress**: an indicator of competition for water resources defined informally as the ratio of demand for water by human society divided by available water. It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0: Low (<10%), 1: Low-medium (10-20%), 2: Medium-high (20-40%), 3: High (40-80%), 4: Extremely high (>80%).\n\n* **Water depletion**: the ratio of total water consumption to available renewable water supplies. Total water consumption includes domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock consumptive uses. Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate larger impact on the local water supply and decreased water availability for downstream users. Water depletion is similar to water stress; however, instead of looking at total water demand, water depletion is calculated using consumptive withdrawal only. It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0 : Low (<5%), 1: Low-medium (5-25%), 2 : Medium-high (25-50%), 3: High (50-75%), 4 : Extremely high (>75%).\n\n[Aqueduct 4.0 FAQ](https://github.com/wri/Aqueduct40/blob/master/data_FAQ.md) explains why the water supply and demand values are measured as fluxes instead of volumes. Volumes (cubic meters) can vary significantly based on the size of each sub-basin, potentially misleading as they might primarily reflect a larger geographical area rather than indicating a higher rate of water flow. On the other hand, fluxes (centimeters/year), which measure the rate of water flow, offer a more direct and equitable means of comparing water availability between different sub-basins. Volume = Flux x Area.\n\nThe spatial resolution is 5 \u00c3\u2014 5 arc minutes which equates roughly to 10 kilometer (km) \u00c3\u2014 10 km pixels. \nThe future projections were created using CMIP6 climate forcings based on three future scenarios: optimistic (ssp126), business-as-usual (ssp370), and pessimistic (ssp585) available at [HYPFLOWSCI6](https://public.yoda.uu.nl/geo/UU01/YM7A5H.html).

            "description": "The World Resources Institute (WRI) [Aqueduct 4.0](https://www.wri.org/data/aqueduct-global-maps-40-data) is the latest iteration of [WRI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water risk framework](https://www.wri.org/data/aqueduct-water-risk-atlas) designed to translate complex \nhydrological data into intuitive indicators of water-related risk:\n\n* **Water demand**: gross demand is the maximum potential water required to meet sectoral demands. Sectoral water demand includes: domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock. Demand is displayed as a flux (centimeters/year).\n\n* **Water supply**: available blue water, the total amount of renewable freshwater available to a sub-basin with upstream consumption removed, includes surface flow, interflow, and groundwater recharge. Available blue water is displayed as a flux (centimeters/year).\n\n* **Water stress**: an indicator of competition for water resources defined informally as the ratio of demand for water by human society divided by available water. It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0: Low (<10%), 1: Low-medium (10-20%), 2: Medium-high (20-40%), 3: High (40-80%), 4: Extremely high (>80%).\n\n* **Water depletion**: the ratio of total water consumption to available renewable water supplies. Total water consumption includes domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock consumptive uses. Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate larger impact on the local water supply and decreased water availability for downstream users. Water depletion is similar to water stress; however, instead of looking at total water demand, water depletion is calculated using consumptive withdrawal only. It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0 : Low (<5%), 1: Low-medium (5-25%), 2 : Medium-high (25-50%), 3: High (50-75%), 4 : Extremely high (>75%).\n\n[Aqueduct 4.0 FAQ](https://github.com/wri/Aqueduct40/blob/master/data_FAQ.md) explains why the water supply and demand values are measured as fluxes instead of volumes. Volumes (cubic meters) can vary significantly based on the size of each sub-basin, potentially misleading as they might primarily reflect a larger geographical area rather than indicating a higher rate of water flow. On the other hand, fluxes (centimeters/year), which measure the rate of water flow, offer a more direct and equitable means of comparing water availability between different sub-basins. Volume = Flux x Area.\n\nThe spatial resolution is 5 \u00c3\u2014 5 arc minutes which equates roughly to 10 kilometer (km) \u00c3\u2014 10 km pixels. \nThe future projections were created using CMIP6 climate forcings based on three future scenarios: optimistic (ssp126), business-as-usual (ssp370), and pessimistic (ssp585) available at [HYPFLOWSCI6](https://public.yoda.uu.nl/geo/UU01/YM7A5H.html).
