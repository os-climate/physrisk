Flood intensity is provided as a _return period_ map: each point comprises a curve of inundation depths for 9 different return periods (also known as reoccurrence periods).

Flood intensity is provided as a _return period_ map: each point comprises a curve of inundation depths for 9 different return periods (also known as reoccurrence periods). If a flood event has depth $d_i$ with return period of $r_i$ this implies that the probability of a flood event with depth greater than $d_i$ occurring in any one year is $1 / r_i$; this is the _exceedance probability_. Aqueduct Floods is based on Global Flood Risk with IMAGE Scenarios (GLOFRIS); see [here](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/publications) for more details.\n\nFor more details and relevant citations see the\n[OS-Climate Physical Climate Risk Methodology document](https://github.com/os-climate/physrisk/blob/main/methodology/PhysicalRiskMethodology.pdf).",

Synthetic tropical cyclone datasets can help overcome these problems. Here we present a new global dataset created by IRIS, the ImpeRIal college Storm Model. IRIS is novel because, unlike other synthetic TC models, it only simulates the decay from the point of lifetime maximum intensity. This minimises the bias in the dataset. It takes input from 42 years of observed tropical cyclones and creates a 10,000 year synthetic dataset which is then validated against the observations. IRIS captures important statistical characteristics of the observed data. The return periods of the landfall maximum wind speed (1 minute sustained in m/s) are realistic globally. Climate model projections are used to adjust the life-time maximum intensity.  \nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/research/climate-science/modelling-tropical-cyclones/\n",
